        <p>
          Originally from Hawick in the Scottish Borders, I began my studies in
          2013 by embarking on the foundation Art & Design in Galashiels at
          Borders College before moving up<br />
          to Edinburgh for 2 further years of studying on the Contemporary Art
          Practice course at Edinburgh College graduating in 2017.
          <br /><br />Since the very beginning I’ve had an interest in
          documenting the world around me. I still remember in my preteens
          showing my family some photographs I had taken whilst we were on
          holiday in Nairn in the North of Scotland, and getting positive -
          sometimes surprised - feedback. <br /><br />Through college I’ve
          developed further interests in creating video work and editing
          software. Eventually I began photographing<br />
          friends at events and taking bookings for weddings. This accelerated
          my experience and is still driving me to maintain as many personal
          projects I can. These are mostly photography and video based, with
          some graphic design related artworks also. <br /><br />This collection
          of images act as a representation of my work and active photography
          practice.
